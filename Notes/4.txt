- first install socket.io
- command: npm install socket.io

- we have to somewhat refactor the code 
- we imported http and created server using http and passed our created app to it 
- also changed app.listen to server.listen
- imported socket.io

- actually socketio receives http server as input argument that why we changed the code
- internally express does this changing to http by default, but we can't extract that and pass to socketio
- so manually we have to do this

- when using socketio, the socketio also sets up client side file that clients can use

- we are loading a script in index.html which does not exist anywhere,but we can use it as we 
- have configured our server to work with socket.io

- then our own client side js file is created (in public -> js(folder) -> chat.js)
- and that will be loaded in index.html and use whatever is provided by the script written recently

- for us to see when connection happen we write a function using io.on in index.js

- in chat.js created we can call io()  which is because of the script we can do
- io() call is enough to connect to the server as a client
