- Websocket Protocol
- firstly we will have a nodejs application that starts up a server
- then clients can connect to that server

- Websocket will allow full duplex communication
- bidirectional communication means client can initiate communication with the server and the 
- server can initiate communication with the client --> this facility was not available with http requests
- with http requests it was client job to initiate the request and asking for data from the server
- and then server will respond
- so if client does not send request to server, then server won't be able to send anything to client

- in Websocket we have a persistent connection which means clients connect to server and remains 
- connected as long as it needs to

- so suppose there are four client c1,c2,c3,c4 and one server s 
- c1 sends message to s 
- then upon receiving message from c1 , s will send c1's message to c2 c3 c4
- so here server to client communication is happening
- so both directions communication is happening. client to server and server to client
